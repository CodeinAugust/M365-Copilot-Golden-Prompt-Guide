## 1. Prompt Usage Guide - Key Concepts
A prompt is a **question or command** that a user inputs into an AI model. 
Large language models (LLMs) like Copilot provide information or perform tasks based on user requests. Writing **clear and specific prompts** can yield better results.

### Key Tips
- **Go through sufficient trial and error**: Writing the optimal prompt requires multiple attempts. To create prompts that work in various environments, invest time in creating your own golden prompts.
- **Understand that the same prompt can yield different results each time**: Due to the nature of generative AI, the same prompt can produce different answers each time.
- **Understand evolving models**: Just like smartphone operating systems get updates, LLM versions are periodically updated. Remember that performance can improve or change accordingly. If the LLM model you are using is updated, be sure to keep an eye on it.
- **Write prompts clearly and logically**: Write prompts logically and clearly so that Copilot can easily understand them, just as you would submit a report to your boss. There is no need to unnecessarily lengthen the prompt.
- **Understand the capabilities of LLM**: Identify tasks that Copilot can perform well and design prompts accordingly. Start with short prompts to understand the functionality, and gradually increase the length to create your own prompts.
- **Share useful prompts**: Share prompts that were useful in actual work with your colleagues. Good prompts are those that each person uses frequently.
